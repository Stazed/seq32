<p>
  After you run Seq32 for the first time, it will generate a <code>.seq32rc</code> file in your
  home directory. It contains data for remote MIDI control, keyboard control, and MIDI clock.
</p>

<h2><code>[midi-control]</code></h2>

<p>
  For each sequence, you can set up MIDI events to turn a sequence on, off, or toggle it.
  In the <code>[midi-control]</code> section you will see lines like:
</p>

<pre>
0  [0 0 0 0 0 0]   [0 0 0 0 0 0]   [0 0 0 0 0 0]
1  [0 0 0 0 0 0]   [0 0 0 0 0 0]   [0 0 0 0 0 0]
2  [0 0 0 0 0 0]   [0 0 0 0 0 0]   [0 0 0 0 0 0]
...
</pre>

<p>
  The first number is the sequence number in the main window. Each set of brackets is a MIDI
  filter. If the incoming MIDI event matches the filter, it will perform <b>toggle</b>, <b>on</b>,
  or <b>off</b> for the sequence respectively.
</p>

<h3>Filter format</h3>
<p>The layout of each filter inside a bracket is:</p>

<pre>
[(on/off) (inverse) (midi status byte (channel ignored)) (data1) (data2 min) (data2 max)]
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>If <code>(on/off)</code> is <code>1</code>, the filter is active and will match incoming MIDI.</li>
  <li>If it matches, the action (toggle/on/off) is performed if the data falls in the specified range.</li>
  <li>All values are in decimal.</li>
  <li>The last three values define the matching data range.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: MIDI note 21 on/off to turn sequence 1 on/off</h3>

<pre>
Toggle                 On                         Off
1 [0 0 0 0 0 0]         [1 0  144 21 0 127]          [1 0 128 21 0 127]
</pre>

<p>
  The <code>inverse</code> field makes the sequence perform the opposite action if the incoming
  data falls outside the specified range. This lets you map several sequences to one knob/fader.
</p>

<h3>Example: Map a row of sequences to one knob (Control Code 1)</h3>

<pre>
Toggle            On                    Off
0  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1   0   15]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
1  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1  16   31]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
2  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1  32   47]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
3  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1  48   63]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
4  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1  64   79]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
5  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1  80   95]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
6  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1  96  111]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
7  [0 0 0 0 0 0]  [1 1 176 1 112  127]  [0 0 0 0 0 0]
</pre>

<h2>MIDI Transport Control</h2>

<p>
  MIDI control has been extended for transport control, recording, screen set adjustment,
  and playlist adjustment. Transport supports start, stop, fast forward, rewind, and
  beginning-of-song.
</p>

<p>
  All transport controls are channel-specific. MIDI channels are numbered 0–15 in the status
  byte math, while Seq32 displays channels as 1–16 (subtract 1 when setting).
</p>

<pre>
Note On              = 144 + channel (0 to 15)
Note Off             = 128 + channel (0 to 15)
Control Code (CC)    = 176 + channel (0 to 15)
</pre>

<h3>Example: screen set adjustment by CC value and “up” key</h3>
<p>
    For screen set adjustment, ability to adjust by CC value has been added to
    the screen set up group section. Use the toggle section to adjust by value.
    The following will allow value adjustment using CC (177), number 4, and also
    allow single up adjustment using A0 (note 21), on channel 2.
</p>

<pre>
# screen set up (value, up, up)
66 [1 0 177   4   0 127] [1 0 145  21   0 127] [0 0   0   0   0   0]
</pre>

<h3>Example: start playing (toggle/start/stop)</h3>
<p>
    The following would set play to toggle start/stop with note press C8 (midi note 108)
    on channel 1, to start only with A#7 (note 106), to stop only with A7 (note 105):
</p>

<pre>
# start playing (toggle, start, stop)
74 [1 0 144 108   0 127] [1 0 144 106   0 127] [1 0 144 105   0 127]
</pre>

<h3>Recording</h3>
<p>
  The record group toggles recording on/off for all sequences with an open sequence editor.
  When recording, only start/stop and record MIDI controls are active; those events are not
  passed through.
</p>
<p>
    Example to set record to toggle with A0 (note 21). The toggle group and off
    group work for record and can also be used and will always toggle:
</p>

<pre>
# record
75 [0 0   0   0   0   0] [1 0 144  21   0 127] [0 0   0   0   0   0]
</pre>

<h3>Fast forward example (press to forward, release to stop)</h3>
<p>
    Fast forward with note-on (144) B7 (note 107) when pressed, and to stop when
    the key is released note-off (128):
</p>

<pre>
# fast forward (forward, forward, stop)
76 [0 0   0   0   0   0] [1 0 144 107   0 127] [1 0 128 107   0 127]
</pre>

<p>Rewind works similarly to fast forward.</p>

<h3>Beginning of song example</h3>

<p>
    Beginning of song will move the transport to the beginning of the song or the 
    left (L) grid marker. Each section can be used and will only set to the marker.
    Following will use A#7 (note 106) to set:
</p>

<pre>
# beginning of song
78 [0 0   0   0   0   0] [1 0 144 106   0 127] [0 0   0   0   0   0]
</pre>

<p>
    
</p>

<h3><a href="playlist_mode.html">[9] Playlist Mode</a> MIDI control (transport stopped)</h3>
<p>
    Midi control for playlist will only be active when seq32 transport is stopped. You
    can set the playlist value while running but the selected file will not be loaded
    until the sequencer stops. If the sequencer is stopped by a stop marker, then
    the playlist will set the file at the next file past the selected value. The program
    will range check for validity, and the file list starts at 1.
    For playlist, the toggle group can be used to send by CC value, the on group for next, 
    and off group for previous.
    Example to set playlist to adjust by value, CC (176), CC number 7. Playlist Next is set
    to note A0 (21) and previous is set to A#0 (22):
</p>

<pre>
79 [1 0 176   7   1 127] [1 0 144  21   0 127] [1 0 144  22   0 127]
</pre>

<h2><code>[mute-group]</code></h2>

<p>
  This section controls 32 groups of mutes in the same way as defined for <code>[midi-control]</code>.
  A group is a set of sequences that toggle their playing state together. Every group contains
  all 32 sequences in the active screen set.
</p>

<p>
  Here are the definitions of the state of the 32 sequences when a group is selected:
</p>

<pre>
group [state of the first 8 sequences] [second 8] [third 8] [fourth 8]
</pre>

<h2>Other sections</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>[midi-clock]</code> — clocking state from the last run (0 = off, 1 = on).</li>
  <li><code>[manual-alsa-ports]</code> — 1 exposes ALSA ports to JACK; 0 uses manual ALSA connections.</li>
  
  <li><code>[vertical-zoom-sequence]</code> — Sets default vertical zoom for the
      <a href="sequence_editor.html">[5] Sequence Editor Window</a> (value 1 to 17 - default 1).</li>

  <li><code>[vertical-zoom-song]</code> — Sets default vertical zoom for the song editor
      tracks on the <a href="song_editor.html">[6] Song Editor Window</a> (value 1 to 50 - default 9).</li>

  <li><code>[horizontal-zoom-song]</code> — Sets default horizontal zoom for the song editor
      tracks on the <a href="song_editor.html">[6] Song Editor Window</a> (value 0 to 60 - default 12).</li>

  <li><code>[keyboard-control]</code> — dump of keys Seq32 recognizes for sequences in the active screen set.</li>
  <li><code>[keyboard-group]</code> — similar to <code>[keyboard-control]</code>, but for groups.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<div class="note">
  <ul>
    <li>To see key codes when pressed, run Seq32 with <code>--show_keys</code>.</li>
    <li>Seq32 overwrites <code>.seq32rc</code> on quit. Quit Seq32 before editing the file.</li>
    <li>
      Some keys should not be assigned to control sequences because they are already used
      by menu shortcuts (Ctrl-based).
    </li>
  </ul>
