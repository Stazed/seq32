[x] Test Maxim Patches w/ wheel mouse
    Make sure data entry still does its thing w/ wheel

 1) when clicking on an event only one (the "topmost") event is selected.
 useful to decouple two events that are eventually stocked on top one another
 2) if there are any events selected, data editor only changes controller.
 values for these events; if there are no events selected it acts as usual.
 3) data editor slope line can be dragged outside of data editor window;
 controller values are adjusted to fit (0,127).
 makes it easier setting all controllers to min/max value.
 4) mouse wheel scrolls the grid up/down in sequence editor and song editor.
